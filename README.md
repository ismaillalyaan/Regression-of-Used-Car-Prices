# Used Car Prices Best Predictions!!

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating used car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to provide the best predictions for used car prices, aiding both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

## Introduction

Used car prices can vary significantly based on numerous factors. This project explores different machine learning algorithms to find the most accurate method for predicting these prices. The goal is to create a reliable model that can assist users in evaluating car prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various attributes of used cars, including:

- **Make:** Brand of the car
- **Model:** Model of the car
- **Year:** Manufacturing year
- **Mileage:** Total distance traveled
- **Condition:** State of the car (new, used, etc.)
- **Price:** Target variable (what we aim to predict)

You can find the dataset in the `data` directory.
