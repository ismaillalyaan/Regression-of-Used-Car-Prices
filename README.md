## Introduction

Used car prices can vary significantly based on numerous factors. This project explores different machine learning algorithms to find the most accurate method for predicting these prices. The goal is to create a reliable model that can assist users in evaluating car prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various attributes of used cars, including:

- **id:** Unique identifier for each car
- **brand:** Brand of the car
- **model:** Model of the car
- **model_year:** Manufacturing year
- **mileage:** Total distance traveled
- **fuel_type:** Type of fuel used
- **engine:** Engine specifications
- **transmission:** Type of transmission (automatic/manual)
- **ext_col:** Exterior color of the car
- **int_col:** Interior color of the car
- **accident:** Indicator of whether the car has been in an accident (yes/no)
- **clean_title:** Indicator of whether the car has a clean title (yes/no)
- **price:** Target variable (what we aim to predict)

You can find the dataset in the `data` directory.
